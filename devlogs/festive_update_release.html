Get in the festive spirit in a new adventure with Tonii! There's plenty to enjoy in this new update, including a brand-new level! If you have already beaten the game, check back in Level 5. You may notice something different...<br><br>
<img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE0NDQxNDg3LnBuZw==/original/jlekQ9.png" alt=""><br><br>
New characters, new mechanics and new puzzles await you in this holiday level!<br>
<br>
In addition, we have added a speedrun mode! Race to beat the game as fast as you can, whether it's the full game, or individual levels! We also now have a <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Tonii">speedrun.com</a> page, which will be open for run submissions shortly.<br>
<br>
On another note, we are currently looking at porting the game to Mac and Web, along with possibly controller and mobile ports. No promises on any of these, but we want as many people to be able to play Tonii as possible.<br>
<br>
So check out The Festive Update! And if you haven't played Tonii before, we'd really appreciate if you gave it a go.<br>
<br>
Also, a reminder that all of our soundtracks are available to listen to on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FossilpawStudios">our Youtube</a>, including the new tracks for the update!<br>
<br>
<i>Have a happy holiday and a great new year!</i><br>
