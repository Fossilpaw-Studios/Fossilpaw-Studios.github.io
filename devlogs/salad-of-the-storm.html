We have just been taking part in the Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2. We were given the theme "Calm Before the Storm". We eventually ended up with this: Salad of the Storm!<br>
<br>
A storm's coming, but you still need to make money from your farm!<br>
<br>
Dodge your produce to sell it and try make a profit!<br>
<br>
The complete 4-song soundtrack is up on YouTube right now!<br>
