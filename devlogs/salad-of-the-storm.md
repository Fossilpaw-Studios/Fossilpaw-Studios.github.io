Salad of the Storm is out!^

We have just been taking part in the Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2. We were given the theme "Calm Before the Storm". We eventually ended up with this: Salad of the Storm!

A storm's coming, but you still need to make money from your farm!

Dodge your produce to sell it and try make a profit!

The complete 4-song soundtrack is up on YouTube right now!
