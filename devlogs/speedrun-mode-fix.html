    <h1 style="color: white;">SPEEDRUN MODE FIX</h1>
    <p class="text-wrapper">
      Hello, this is Ratamacue-9112, the composer and programmer of Tonii. I have just issued the new 1.1.1 update, which mainly adds fixes to Speedrun Mode. I did not do proper testing on this so it released in an unstable state. Sorry about that. I highly recommend you update to the new version. There is a full changelog below.
      <br><br>
      On a similar note, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Tonii">Tonii on speedrun.com</a> now has categories and is open for submissions! I should mention, just cause I was bored, there are a couple intentional glitches in the game that would help with speedrunning. Let's see if you guys can find them...
      <br><br>
      Using these glitches, I managed to beat the game in 3:41.16. Can you beat that?
      <br><br>
