Over the past 4 days we have been participating in the GMTK Game Jam 2024. The jam had the theme "Built to Scale", and this is what we came up with: Subject 031!<br>
<br>
White Desert Laboratory has recently been constructing the new "Blue Box Resizer Gun" and lucky for you, you have been chosen to participate in the Pre-Alpha test!<br>
<br>
The Gun is completely "safe" and "won't" do any of the bad "things" it did to the last 30 "subjects", you lucky "chap".<br>
<br>
Use the Gun to resize and move boxes and solve puzzles in this short but sweet 2D puzzle platformer.<br>
<br>
The soundtrack is fully up on YouTube as well!<br>
