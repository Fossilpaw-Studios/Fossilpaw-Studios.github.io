Tonii is now playable in your browser! We still do recommend the download version, but if you don't want to, this is an easier option. The 1.1.2 update has also been released for download and browser, with a few minor bug fixes <a href="full changelog below"></a>.<br>
<br>
This will probably be the last Tonii update for a while, as we are about to begin on a new project <a href="more on that later in the year"></a>.<br>
